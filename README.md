# BDSP text files
All the text files for the gen 8 Pok√©mon games Brilliant Diamond and Shining
Pearl, in all the languages those games support.

The text files in BDSP are formatted differently from the rest of the series,
so these are being stored separately from my main pokemon_text_dumps repository.

Also included is a handy script for parsing these hundreds of files into a more
useful form.
